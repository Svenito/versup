Versup documentation
====================

Versup automates versioning up a project by creating a commit, tagging the release,
creating a changelog, and updating the version across files. Of course, this is all
configurable.

Quickstart
==========

All versup needs is the increment or new version number. If you just want to increase
the semantic version you can invoke it with

.. code:: bash

   versup minor

or if you want to specify the version with

.. code:: bash

   versup 1.72.3


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
